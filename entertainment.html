                                                    In order to strengthen self-confidence, feelings of success, resilience, social engagement, and social skills, creative activities and art are crucial during the sensitive developmental period of children and adolescents (Zarobe & Bungay, 2017). Children and teenagers use creativity to express their inner world, find themselves, integrate their identities, form social networks, and grow empathetic and understanding of other people's actions and reactions. Social group members can identify and communicate feelings and thoughts that they might not otherwise be able to articulate by engaging in creative activities. According to Rouillette (2009), art fosters the growth of an individual's critical thinking skills and provides a perspective on the world through intricate details. Furthermore, as noted by Coholic, Schwabe, and Lander (2020), art and creative processes serve as a means of simulating events that young people experience outside of their social group in the outside world on a daily basis. 
                                                    Encouraging young people to participate in creative activities can take many forms, including working with clay, writing, reading, performing arts, drama, drawing, painting, singing, dancing, and many more.

                                                    Given all these advantages, which are essential for the development of youth in a healthful manner, particular attention needs to be paid to how best to promote these kinds of activities among youth. Research indicates that it is critical to promote young people's healthy development because of their unique vulnerability during their formative years to mental health issues and illnesses that, if left undiagnosed and untreated, carry over into adulthood.

                                                <p>Historically, it has been believed that the ability to create and appreciate music was a necessity for the first human civilizations. For most adolescents, music is a major part of their lives and a vital means of meeting their emotional, social, and cognitive needs (North, Harhreaves, & O'Neill, 2000). Every adolescent must complete the essential task of developing a personal identity, and music plays a significant role in that process. But have you ever wondered how music changes our brains? It activates various brain regions in the passive listener (amygdala, primary auditory cortex, and a portion of the thalamus); when we actively participate in the music, our brain activates the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and the motor portion of the cortex. In other words, the teenage brain engages multiple brain regions when listening to music passively, and it grows exponentially when the adolescent listens actively. 
                                                    According to research, listening to music can help reduce a variety of mental states, including stress, anxiety, and different cognitive and emotional processes.

                                                     Many forms of music therapy have been developed based on the evidence supporting the positive effects of music on the human brain. These therapies have produced remarkable outcomes, including a decrease in adolescent hostility and aggression, an increase in focus, attention, and motivation, an improvement in social functioning and self-image, and an overall improvement in quality of life (Yinger & Gooding, 2014).
                                                    Due to the fact that these effects help young people live happier and higher-quality lives, it is crucial to support them appropriately during the adolescent stage of life, which is marked by hormone fluctuations, rebellion, and significant social influence.

                                                    It is difficult to be a young person in the modern world, full of challenges, and these same challenges can lead to a variety of mental health issues. The World Health Organization emphasizes the significance of the burden of mental health disorders that young people experience and points out that nearly half of the diseases to which young people and adolescents are exposed globally are disorders from this spectrum. Before the age of 14, half of mental health disorders manifest, and by the end of adolescence, 75% do. Over 13% of teenagers between the ages of 10 and 19 suffer from a mental health disorder, according to UNICEF. This implies that 80 million teenagers between the ages of 10 and 10 and 14 and 86 million adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19 suffer from a mental illness on a global average (Zdunić, 2022). Anxiety disorders, mood disorders, eating disorders, and many other conditions that young people deal with are essential mental health issues. It is imperative to stress that a young person's upbringing and development have a significant impact on their mental health.

Ultimately, the advantages of sports for a young person's personality and mental health are indispensable. Sport offers young people an opportunity to not only engage in physical exercise but also to have fun, accomplish daily tasks, learn how to set and achieve goals, overcome challenges, and develop tolerance. Young people can find a healthy way to decompress and relieve tension through sports, which also have a significant impact on anxiety and depression levels by promoting healthier sleep patterns and daily routines (Gavrilović, 2019).

                                                Adolescence is a time when young people learn about themselves; during this time, they explore their personal preferences and the things they want to surround and incorporate into their identity. Workshops are a very useful tool for developing skills that also improve the quality of life in adulthood, since adolescence is a sensitive time for the development of emotional and social skills. When examining whether emotional and social skills impact and regulate both thoughts and behavior, it is particularly crucial to work with them. People who possess emotional competence are able to identify their own and other people's emotions, use emotions to help with thought processes, comprehend emotions they perceive, and control their emotions (Maliakkal, Hoffmann, Ivcevic, & Brackett, 2016). Art can offer young people an unusual way to work and cooperate, as well as spark their interest in various forms of art, so using it for this kind of work with them is highly appropriate.
                                                Workshops can focus on a variety of issues and concerns that young people encounter, particularly those who belong to risk groups and do not reside in a functional nuclear family. Workshops can be used to learn and better understand specific scientific fields, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (Gairal-Casado, Garcia-Ieste, Novo-Molinero, & Salvado-Belarta, 2019). 
                                                This depends on the needs that have been identified. Certain scientific fields can be highly specialized, depending on the workshop attendees' intended audience.

                                                    It has been acknowledged how crucial workshops are in the field of mental health because they teach youth how to identify and comprehend conditions like depression. Since depression is more common in adolescence and can have serious, life-long effects on an individual, including poor performance in school and in business as an adult, difficulties concentrating, memory, motivation, and other health issues, risky and pseudosuicidal behaviors, and suicide itself, it is especially desirable to include depression in the workshops (Martinez, Espinosa, Zitko, Marin, Schilling, Schverter, & Rojas, 2015).
                                                    The workshops teach young people how to treat themselves and others while also assisting them in identifying the different symptoms of specific psychological conditions.
                                                School systems can also greatly benefit from workshops, as they provide professional and teaching staff with strategies and ways to help adolescents while also helping them recognize the issues and challenges that young people face.
